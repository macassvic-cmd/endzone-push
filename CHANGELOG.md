# Changelog

Judge for model changes: 2025 walk-forward backtest, weeks 4–18, depth-chart active set (`python backtest.py 0.35`,
fast variants via `python search.py`). Brier differences are compared on the rows shared by the variants; the
simulation seed alone moves Brier by about ±0.0001 at n=3000.

## 2026-09-27 — QB rushing fix

Problem: pocket QBs (Stafford, Goff, Rodgers) projected 9–12% anytime TD against a 4–5% market.

Causes found:
- Kneel-downs counted as rush attempts, so a victory-formation kneel at the opponent's 1 credited the QB with a 45%
  expected TD. Stafford had 21 kneels among 35 "carries". Kneels are now excluded everywhere (xTD tables, per-play
  xTD, inside-10 counts, red-zone tab). On its own this is Brier-neutral.
- QBs were stretched with the rest of the pool (listed shares scaled up to 92% of team xTD).
- One flat QB1 rush prior (4.2%) for every quarterback.

Changes (model.py):
- QBs are no longer stretched; teammates keep the same factor as before and the difference goes to "other".
- QB1 rush-share prior = 0.068 + 0.054 × designed runs per game (kneels excluded, capped at 4), fitted on 2025
  depth-chart QB1s. Stafford at 0.46 designed runs/game gets 9.3%, Hurts at 3.6 gets 26%.
- A QB-specific TD-rate table (sneak / designed / scramble by yardline) was built and tested; it over-predicts the
  immobile tier (9.9% vs 8.0%) so it stays off (`QB_OWN_XTD = False`).

Numbers (shared rows, n=3000):

| | Brier | QB Brier | QBs <0.75 designed runs/gm | 2.5+ | Top-15 hits / expected per week |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Before | 0.13180 | 0.13216 | 9.0% pred / 8.0% actual | 23.9 / 28.8 | 7.53 / 7.84 |
| After | 0.13194 | 0.13096 | 8.0 / 8.0 | 24.4 / 28.8 | 7.87 / 7.63 |

Overall Brier is flat within noise; QB Brier improves and the immobile tier is calibrated. Mobile QBs are still
under-predicted (the 1.5–2.5 tier at 20.8% vs 34.5% actual) and are the next QB item.

Week 3 rerun from saved odds: 40 edges (was 45). Stafford 12.0% → 8.4%, Rodgers 11.0% → 5.7%, Goff 9.0% → 8.0%.
Remaining QB edges: Stafford anytime and first TD, Goff anytime; both took a goal-line sneak in 2026 and the
3-game prior does not yet outweigh it.
